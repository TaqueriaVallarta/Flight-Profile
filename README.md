Update the unstable branch, then we will update the main whenever it is working. Need to update main in person

This is where we will note all the important TODOs.
Please note that when using pycharm, if you add a comment like #TODO: your text here

It will warn you if you are commiting and pushing the changes with TODOs (I think)

Finally, please be sure to use Pull Requests before making a push. I would like to be sure that there will not be any new bugs introduced. 
If you are trying to create a new and more detailed addition to the flight profile, use a new branch for it. We will resolve the branches once we meet.
