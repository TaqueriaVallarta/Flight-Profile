This is where we will note all of the important TODOs.
Please note that when using pycahrm, if you add a comment like so:
#TODO: <your todo here>

It will warn you if you are comiting and pushing the changes with TODOs (I think)

Finally, please be sure to use Pull Requests before making a push. I would like to be sure that there will not be any new bugs introduced. 
If you are trying to create a new and more detailed addition to the flight profile, use a new branch for it. We will resolve the branches once we meet.
